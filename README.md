In this project it was given that we have to do serial communication between the PC and MCU .I have taken the Arduino as MCU.
At first we have to send the data to MCU from the PC. I have sent the data to MCU through the python code from the jypiter notebook.
Then after getting the data from the PC we will store it in the EEPROM memory.Now we have send the data back to the PC from the MCU.
